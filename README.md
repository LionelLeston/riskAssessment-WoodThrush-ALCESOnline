# riskAssessment-WoodThrush-ALCESOnline
This R project is for generating species distribution models of Wood Thrush and predicting current and future distribution of this species under an ALCES Online scenario in southern Ontario. This folder differs from “riskAssessment-WoodThrush-Landis” in that the BRT models run here are used for predicting Wood Thrush abundance and distribution from an ALCES Online future land use scenario run in Ontario, where there are insufficient data to run Landis-II scenarios at the present time. This R project includes folders for processing the ArcGIS data that are used to set up the ALCES Online scenario; stores outputs from the ALCES Online scenario that are used to predict Wood Thrush abundance and distribution in 2070 A.D. from 5 simulation runs of the scenario; and processes those outputs to create ZONATION conservation planning exercises for the spatial implementation of options to designate critical habitat for Wood Thrush. While the ZONATION exercises were run outside of this R project, there are self-contained ZONATION folders for each exercise stored within “CHID-ALCES-Online-models” and further processing of the ZONATION outputs takes place within the R project.
